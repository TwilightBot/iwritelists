The TwilightBot issue tracker
==================

Welcome to the TwilightBot issue tracker! This system was set up to help the developers fix and implement IWriteLists bugs and feature requests quickly, easily, and in an efficient manner.

## Reporting issues through Twilight
To report an issue, ask Twilight

    issue <issue message here>

Please be as descriptive but as to the point as possible with your title.

If this is a SECURITY issue, please use ```mentormsg``` right away.

## Rules

1. Make sure the bug or feature request you are looking for hasn't already been filed.
2. Make sure the feature request that you're attempting to file is reasonably feasible.
3. Provide as much information as possible as relevant to your issue or feature request.
4. Click [here](https://github.com/TDLive/iwritelists-issues/issues/new) to open a new issue.
5. Use descriptive titles that show what your bug or feature request is about (e.g. "Help!" is not acceptable; "Twilight crashes on use of the 'bitcoin' command" is.)

Thanks for helping us make IWriteLists the best it can be!
